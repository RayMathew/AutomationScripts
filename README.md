# AutomationScripts

This is a fun personal project to learn automation. As of now (25th Sept 2016) I'm focusing on Python alone, and kiddie scripts at that.

All Python scripts have been written with version 2.7 - you need to install it in your computer for these scripts to work (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/). For 32-bit Windows, choose Windows x86 MSI installer.

Tip - Use these scripts with Windows' Task Scheduler. For example, opening a specific website(s) in Chrome on startup.
