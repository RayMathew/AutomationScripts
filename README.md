# AutomationScripts

This is a fun personal project to learn automation. As of now (25th Sept 2016) I'm focusing on Python alone, and kiddie scripts at that.
Download and use freely. Open them with a Text Editor first, to see further instructions on how to use them.

Summary Of Scripts:
  1. ChromeOpenSites.py:
      Opens your Chrome and a specific list of websites. You can change the list as well as the browser.
      
  2. ResizeImage.py:
      Reduces the size of all images in a folder to the dimensions specified inside the script.

All Python scripts have been written with version 2.7 - you need to install it in your computer for these scripts to work (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/). For 32-bit Windows, choose Windows x86 MSI installer from the link.


Tip - You could use these scripts with Windows' Task Scheduler. For example, opening a specific website(s) in Chrome on startup.
